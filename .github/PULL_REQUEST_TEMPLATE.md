<!--
Thanks for contributing. A short description of why this change is needed is
worth more than a long description of what it does; the diff already says what
it does.

Title: use a Conventional Commit, for example
  feat(diagnostics): report ProviderConfig credential resolution
It becomes the squashed commit message.

## What does this change?

<!-- One or two sentences. -->

## Why?

<!--
What problem does this solve? If it fixes an issue, link it:
Fixes #123
-->

## How did you test it?

<!--
Which Crossplane version and provider did you try this against? "Unit tests
only" is a fine answer for changes that do not touch cluster behaviour.
-->

## Checklist

- [ ] The title is a Conventional Commit
- [ ] Commits are signed off (`git commit --signoff`)
- [ ] Tests cover the behaviour I changed
- [ ] `make check` passes locally
- [ ] The README tool table is updated, if I added or renamed a tool

## Breaking changes

<!--
Renaming or removing a tool, or making an optional argument required, breaks
every user's prompts. If this does that, say so here and explain the migration.
Otherwise write "None".
